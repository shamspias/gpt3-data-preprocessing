# gpt3-data-preprocessing
This GitHub repository contains code for preprocessing text data from PDF and DOCX files for use with GPT-3. It includes steps such as tokenization, removal of stop words and punctuation, and formatting for GPT-3 input.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Python and pip installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following Python packages:

- PyPDF2
- python-docx
- NLTK
- Pandas

You can install these packages by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install pypdf2 python-docx nltk pandas
    ```
## Usage
The code in this repository is meant to be used in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment.

- To preprocess data from a PDF file, use the `pdf_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook or the `pdf_preprocessing.py` script
- To preprocess data from a DOCX file, use the `docx_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook or the `docx_preprocessing.py` script
- Both notebooks contain detailed comments on how to use the code and how it works.

## Contributing
If you have any suggestions for improvements or find any bugs, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Acknowledgments
This code uses the PyPDF2 and python-docx libraries to read and extract text from PDF and DOCX files respectively, and the NLTK library for tokenization and stop word removal.

## Note
It's important to note that the code provided here is a sample, you may want to adapt it to your specific use case and add more preprocessing steps as needed.
Also, it's important to have a big enough dataset to achieve better results with GPT-3.
